# Anomaly-Detection-in-Surveillance-Camera
Today almost every country is trying to build smart cities where CCTVs play a very important role. One of the main goals in building smart city is to build a safe city for the civilians. The main purpose of these CCTV in public areas is for security, activity recognition, people counter and many other use cases. Use cases like activity recognition or behaviour recognition becomes very important in order to detect crime scenes in advance. But this is done under human intervention where a person needs to supervise the activities. With a large network of CCTVs in a city, a human supervision is not sufficient to analyse the data. With the emerging techniques in Deep learning, we came up with a solution by providing a live dashboard of the current status of crime in the city. The model uses LSTM CNN architecture which has been trained with the UCF dataset where it would categorize a scene as “Normal” or “Abnormal”. The project is mainly built by using TensorFlow, OpenCV and Matplotlib.
